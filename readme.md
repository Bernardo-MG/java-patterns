# Java Patterns

A collection of common design patterns for Java.

Not all the design patterns have been included in this library. This is a compilation of only those which I've needed, and only if there wasn't any available implementation for them. 

For each of them an interface and, when possible, also a basic implementation are offered.

## Features

Currently the patterns included are as follows:
- The **Command**, and the **CommandExecutor**, help to encapsulate code inside an object.
- The **Outputter** allows writing for files, or just sending structures, without worrying about the actual implementation.
- The **Parser** transforms one object into another, keeping as much of the data intact as possible.
- The **Prototype** permits creating an identical copy of a base template.
- The **Repository** allows handling data persistence as if you were working on a collection.

## Documentation

Documentation is always generated for the latest release, kept in the 'master' branch:

- The [latest release documentation page][site-release].
- The [the latest release Javadoc site][javadoc-release].

Documentation is also generated from the latest snapshot, taken from the 'develop' branch:

- The [the latest snapshot documentation page][site-develop].
- The [the latest snapshot Javadoc site][javadoc-develop].

The documentation site sources come along the source code (as it is a Maven site), so it is always possible to generate them using the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn verify site
```

The verify phase is required, as otherwise some of the reports won't be created.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

### Prerequisites

The project has been tested on the following Java versions:
* JDK 7
* JDK 8
* OpenJDK 7

All other dependencies are handled through Maven, and noted in the included POM file.

### Installing

The recommended way to install the project is by setting up your preferred dependencies manager. To get the configuration information for this check the [Bintray repository][bintray-repo], or the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo].

If for some reason manual installation is necessary, just use the following Maven command:

```
$ mvn install
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.

## License

The project has been released under the [MIT License][license].
